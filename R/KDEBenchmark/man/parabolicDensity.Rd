\title{Return a bivariate parabolic density}
\usage{
parabolicDensity(coefficient, ray)
}
\arguments{
\item{coefficient:}{the coefficient a in the formula z = a(x^2 + y^2)}

\item{ray:}{the ray of the circular wafer}
}
\value{
list with 2 elemets: the values of the probability function "pdf" and the
grid "grid" where it has been computed.
}
\description{
Computes a bivariate parabolic probability density and return a list containing
the grid used to compute the probability and a matrix with the values of the
probability function. The center of the paraboloid is the one of the wafer.
